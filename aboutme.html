    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My personal time is mostly used to have fun, but sometimes fun cant always happen so I instead read books and increase my knowledge further into the business industry. My plan is to become a consultant while also learning a trade, underwater welding.  One way I'm working towards these goals is by working a part time job at "The Home Depot" as a cashier and building more money to fund my education and increase any assets that could help me make more money such as investing. Education is key if I want to succeed because you can never have too much knowledge about something and can always learn new ways to make more money. I plan on graduating high school and going to college a year after graduating that way I have time to attend trade school. I want to be known as someone who can carry there own and not have to struggle financially.</p>
